# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Materialize each Work into an isolated Docker runtime

**Identifier:** RUNTIME-MATERIALIZE-001

Creating or starting a Work SHALL materialize the Work-owned active context, immutable agent image identity, complete Skill directories, `AGENTS.md`, effective runtime configuration, secret references, and tool policy into an isolated container; create or adopt one labeled Work network, persistent data/session storage, internal runtime identity, and one agentd container; then wait for verified readiness. Reconciliation MUST adopt matching resources and MUST NOT create two active agentd instances for one Work. The container SHALL receive only that Work's active owned context and MUST NOT read Core defaults, Core-managed Skill artifacts, operator import paths, host user Skill directories, another Work context, or pending desired context.

#### Scenario: Start one Work from its active context
- **WHEN** Core reconciles a valid Work whose desired lifecycle state is running
- **THEN** exactly one agentd container starts with the Work's retained data, Sessions, complete copied Skill trees, AGENTS content, runtime configuration, model credential reference, resource limits, and private network

#### Scenario: Start one Work from an accepted configuration
- **WHEN** Core starts a Work after its creation context was completely copied and accepted
- **THEN** exactly one agentd container receives that Work-owned active context and reaches readiness without rereading Core defaults or Skill sources

#### Scenario: Reconcile an existing instance
- **WHEN** Core repeats reconciliation after losing process state
- **THEN** it adopts the matching labeled container and Work-owned storage after verification instead of creating a duplicate or rereading a Skill import path

#### Scenario: Restart after a Core Skill changes
- **WHEN** a managed Skill used to create Work A is updated, disabled, removed, or its original source path disappears before Work A restarts
- **THEN** Work A restarts with the complete Skill copy in its active context and its behavior does not change

#### Scenario: Reject active context failure
- **WHEN** the Work-owned active context is missing, corrupted, or fails validation
- **THEN** the Operation fails with the Work and safe field identity, no partial or pending context is mounted, and no Run is accepted

#### Scenario: Reject context materialization failure
- **WHEN** Core cannot safely mount or validate the complete Work-owned context selected for an operation
- **THEN** the Operation fails with a safe Work and field identity, the prior active context remains usable when present, and no partial context is used by a Run

### Requirement: Execute Runs through the real Pi SDK

**Identifier:** RUNTIME-PI-001

Agentd SHALL durably accept a prompt and submission key, execute the Run with the configured model through the Pi SDK, persist ordered mapped events and a unique terminal state, and save the resulting Session history. A client or Core observation disconnect MUST NOT abort execution; explicit cancellation MUST request SDK abort and persist the resulting state. Each Session SHALL be constructed with the active Work-owned resource loader, including every file in its copied Skills, its AGENTS content, and its resolved tool policy.

#### Scenario: Receive a deterministic acceptance reply through the real stack
- **WHEN** the acceptance fixture submits a prompt to a real agentd container configured with the deterministic model
- **THEN** the real Pi SDK executes it, agentd persists its events and result, and the CLI receives the expected assistant text through Core

#### Scenario: Use a real configured model
- **WHEN** the optional smoke is enabled with valid provider credentials and a user submits a prompt
- **THEN** agentd executes the Run through the configured real Pi SDK model and returns a non-empty assistant result

#### Scenario: Load complete Skill directories from the Work
- **WHEN** a Run uses a Skill whose instructions reference a copied script, reference, or template below that Skill directory
- **THEN** the Pi SDK resource loader exposes that Work-owned file and does not resolve it through a Core or host path

#### Scenario: Isolate Session context
- **WHEN** a Run starts for a Work with active Skills and AGENTS content
- **THEN** the Pi SDK exposes exactly that Work context and cannot load another Work, Core-managed source content, host user Skills, or pending desired content

#### Scenario: Session context is loaded from the Work
- **WHEN** a Session is created or restored for a ready Work
- **THEN** its Pi SDK resource loader reads the Work-owned active Skills and AGENTS content rather than resolving a Core or host source

#### Scenario: Retry a lost submit response
- **WHEN** Core repeats the same Session, submission key, and prompt after losing the first response
- **THEN** agentd returns the original Run and does not invoke the model a second time
